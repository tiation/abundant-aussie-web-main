## Current State Analysis

### Repository Status Overview

| Repository | Type | Status | Integration Level | Cloud Readiness |
|------------|------|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| RiggerShared | Library | ✅ Complete | ❌ Not integrated | 🟡 Partially ready |
| RiggerBackend | API/Services | ✅ Active dev | ❌ Standalone | 🟡 Partially ready |
| RiggerHub-web | Frontend | ✅ Active dev | ❌ Not using shared | 🔴 Not ready |
| RiggerConnect-web | Frontend | ✅ Active dev | ❌ Not using shared | 🔴 Not ready |
| RiggerConnect-android | Mobile | ✅ Feature complete | ❌ No shared integration | 🔴 Not ready |
| RiggerConnect-ios | Mobile | ✅ Stable | ❌ No shared integration | 🔴 Not ready |
| RiggerHub-android | Mobile | ✅ Stable | ❌ No shared integration | 🔴 Not ready |
| RiggerHub-ios | Mobile | ✅ Stable | ❌ No shared integration | 🔴 Not ready |
| RiggerConnect-capacitor | Hybrid | 🟡 In development | ❌ No shared integration | 🔴 Not ready |

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Zero Integration**: No repository currently uses RiggerShared despite its comprehensive utilities
2. **Duplicated Logic**: Each repository implements its own logging, validation, constants
3. **Inconsistent Architecture**: No unified approach to configuration, environment management
4. **Missing CI/CD**: Incomplete deployment pipelines across repositories
5. **No Service Mesh**: Backend services not properly orchestrated
6. **Security Gaps**: No unified authentication/authorization across platforms

- [ ] Set up monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
```

### Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation (Weeks 9-12)

#### 3.1 GitHub Actions Workflows
**Priority: High**

**Per Repository Strategy:**
```yaml
# Shared workflow structure across all repos:
.github/workflows/
├── ci.yml              # Testing, linting, building
├── cd-staging.yml      # Deploy to staging
├── cd-production.yml   # Deploy to production  
├── dependency-update.yml # Automated dependency updates
└── security-scan.yml   # Security scanning
```

#### 3.2 Deployment Environments
**Priority: High**
