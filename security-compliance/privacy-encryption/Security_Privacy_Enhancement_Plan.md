# Security & Privacy Enhancement Plan
# ChaseWhiteRabbit NGO - RiggerConnect Ecosystem
# Focus: User Privacy, Encryption, and Secure Token Handling (JWT, OAuth2)

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to strengthen user privacy, improve encryption mechanisms, and enhance token handling practices within the RiggerConnect ecosystem.

## Objectives
1. Strengthen user privacy handling in all applications.
2. Implement robust encryption for data at rest and in transit.
3. Optimize the handling of tokens such as JWT and OAuth2 with industry best practices.

## User Privacy
### Policies
- Implement a comprehensive privacy policy aligning with applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
- Provide users with transparent insights about their data usage and privacy controls.

### Data Minimization
- Conduct a data inventory and minimize the collection of PII (Personally Identifiable Information) to only what is necessary for application functionality.

### Data Anonymization 
- Implement anonymization techniques for any analytics data.

### Access Controls
- Enforce strict access controls to sensitive user data.
- Regularly audit access logs and permissions.

## Encryption
### Encryption in Transit
- Ensure all data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- Regularly renew SSL certificates and test for vulnerabilities using SSL Labs.

### Encryption at Rest
- Ensure databases and file storage use AES-256 encryption or stronger.
- Implement key rotation policies.

## Secure Token Handling
### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Use strong signing algorithms (e.g., RS256).
- Regularly rotate signing keys.
- Implement short-lived tokens to reduce potential exposure.
- Ensure payload data is minimal and does not include sensitive information.

### OAuth 2.0
- Adhere to RFC 6749 (OAuth 2.0) standards.
- Implement and support current OAuth extensions such as PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange).
- Regularly audit third-party application access and revoke unnecessary permissions.
