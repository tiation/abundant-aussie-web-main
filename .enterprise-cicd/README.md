# Enterprise CI/CD System

## Overview
This enterprise-grade CI/CD system provides automated code quality checks, testing, security scanning, and deployment across all Tiation repositories with automated agents and runners that check all code and changes.

## üéØ Key Features

### Automated Code Checking
- **Security Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanner for dependencies and containers
- **Secret Detection**: GitLeaks to prevent credential leaks
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, Black, Flake8 for consistent code standards
- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and coverage reporting
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Local validation before code is committed
- **Pre-push Hooks**: Final checks before pushing to remote

### Multi-Language Support
- **Node.js**: ESLint, Prettier, npm test, Docker builds
- **Python**: Black, Flake8, pytest with coverage
- **Go**: go fmt, go vet, go test with race detection
- **Docker**: Container security scanning and optimization

### Infrastructure Integration
- **8 VPS Servers**: Full health monitoring and deployment coordination
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows for all repositories
- **GitLab CI**: Alternative CI/CD pipeline support
- **Docker Registry**: Container builds and security scanning

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### VPS Infrastructure
- **docker.sxc.codes** (145.223.22.7) - Primary CI/CD runner
- **docker.tiation.net** (145.223.22.9) - Secondary runner
- **gitlab.sxc.codes** (145.223.22.10) - GitLab orchestration
- **helm.sxc.codes** (145.223.21.248) - Kubernetes management
- **grafana.sxc.codes** (153.92.214.1) - Monitoring dashboards
- **elastic.sxc.codes** (145.223.22.14) - Log aggregation
- **supabase.sxc.codes** (93.127.167.157) - Database services
- **ubuntu.sxc.codes** (89.116.191.60) - General purpose

### Automated Agents
The system includes intelligent agents that automatically:
- Check code quality on every commit
- Run security scans before deployment
- Monitor infrastructure health
- Send alerts when issues are detected
- Coordinate deployments across environments

## üöÄ Usage

### Health Check All Servers
```bash
.enterprise-cicd/scripts/enterprise-deployer.sh health
```

### Deploy Application
```bash
# Deploy to staging
.enterprise-cicd/scripts/enterprise-deployer.sh deploy myapp staging

# Deploy to production
.enterprise-cicd/scripts/enterprise-deployer.sh deploy myapp production

# Deploy to both environments
.enterprise-cicd/scripts/enterprise-deployer.sh deploy myapp all
```

### Manual Testing
Each repository now has pre-commit and pre-push hooks that automatically:
- Check for secrets before commit
- Run linting and formatting checks
- Execute tests before pushing
- Validate code quality standards

## üîí Security Features

### Automated Security Scanning
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Scans for known CVEs in dependencies
- **Secret Detection**: Prevents accidentally committing API keys, passwords
- **Container Security**: Scans Docker images for security issues
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis for security anti-patterns

### Infrastructure Security
- **SSH Key Authentication**: Secure server access
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate staging and production
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Real-time security event detection

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

### Automated Monitoring
- **Pipeline Health**: Continuous monitoring of CI/CD pipelines
- **Server Health**: Regular health checks across all VPS servers
- **Application Performance**: Monitoring deployed applications
- **Security Events**: Real-time security alert system

### Alert Channels
- **Email Notifications**: Sent to key stakeholders
- **Pipeline Failures**: Immediate notification of build failures
- **Security Issues**: Critical security findings escalated immediately

## üéØ Agents and Runners

### What Gets Checked Automatically
1. **Every Commit**: Pre-commit hooks check code quality and secrets
2. **Every Push**: Pre-push hooks run tests and final validations
3. **Every PR**: Full CI pipeline with security scans and tests
4. **Daily Scans**: Scheduled vulnerability and dependency checks
5. **Deployment**: Automated security checks before production deployment

### Intelligent Automation
- **Language Detection**: Automatically applies appropriate checks based on project type
- **Failure Recovery**: Automatic retries and fallback strategies
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching and parallel execution
- **Resource Management**: Efficient use of CI/CD resources

## üîß Configuration

### GitHub Secrets Required
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: For API access and workflow permissions
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: For server deployment access
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY_TOKEN`: For container registry access

### Environment Variables
- `NODE_VERSION`: Node.js version (default: 20)
- `PYTHON_VERSION`: Python version (default: 3.11)
- `GO_VERSION`: Go version (default: 1.21)
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY`: Container registry URL

## üìà Benefits

### For Developers
- **Faster Feedback**: Immediate code quality feedback
- **Reduced Bugs**: Catch issues before they reach production
- **Consistent Standards**: Automated enforcement of coding standards
- **Security Confidence**: Automatic security vulnerability detection

### For Operations
