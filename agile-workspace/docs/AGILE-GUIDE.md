# Agile Development Workflow Guide

## Directory Structure
- `/sprints`: Active sprint work
- `/backlog`: Product backlog items
- `/docs`: Documentation and guides
- `/planning`: Sprint planning and retrospective notes

## Agile Practices

### 1. Sprint Structure
- Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
- Sprint Planning: Beginning of each sprint
- Daily Standups: Quick status updates
- Sprint Review: End of sprint
- Retrospective: After sprint review

### 2. Work Organization
- Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable stories
- Use clear acceptance criteria for each story
- Prioritize tasks by business value and technical dependencies
- Keep track of velocity and adjust accordingly

### 3. Task States
- Backlog
- Sprint Ready
- In Progress
- Review/Testing
- Done

### 4. Definition of Done
- Code complete
- Tests written and passing
- Documentation updated
- Code reviewed
- Acceptance criteria met
- Ready for deployment

### 5. Ceremonies
#### Daily Standup
- What did you complete yesterday?
- What will you work on today?
- Any blockers?

#### Sprint Planning
- Review and estimate backlog items
- Set sprint goals
- Commit to sprint scope

#### Sprint Review
- Demo completed work
- Gather feedback
- Update backlog

#### Retrospective
- What went well?
- What could be improved?
- Action items for next sprint

## Best Practices
1. Keep tasks small and manageable
2. Update task status daily
3. Communicate blockers early
4. Document decisions and technical choices
5. Regular backlog refinement
6. Continuous integration/deployment
