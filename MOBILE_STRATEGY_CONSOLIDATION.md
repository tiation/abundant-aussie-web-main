## Unified Mobile Strategy

### 1. Platform Alignment & Feature Parity

#### Primary Strategy: Capacitor-First Development
**Recommendation**: Prioritize Capacitor as the primary mobile platform with native platforms as secondary implementations.

**Rationale**:
- 95% code reuse with existing web platform
- Rapid development cycle (3x faster than native)
- Unified design system and component library
- Consistent user experience across all platforms
- Lower maintenance overhead

#### Secondary Strategy: Native Platform Optimization
**Approach**: Maintain native platforms for performance-critical features and platform-specific requirements.

**Native-Specific Features**:
- Complex animations and transitions
- Heavy computational tasks (job matching algorithms)
- Deep OS integration (widgets, shortcuts)
- Performance-critical operations

### 2. Feature Parity Roadmap (47 Screens)

#### Phase 1: Core Features Alignment (Weeks 1-4)

### 4. Code Reuse Strategy

#### Shared Component Architecture
```typescript
// Platform-agnostic component structure
interface PlatformAdapter {
  render: (component: ReactComponent) => NativePlatformComponent;
  bridge: (webAPI: WebAPI) => NativeAPI;
  optimize: (component: Component) => OptimizedComponent;
}

// Implementation layers
class RiggerConnectPlatforms {
  capacitor: CapacitorPlatform;
  android: AndroidPlatform;
  ios: iOSPlatform;
  web: WebPlatform;
}
```

#### Shared Business Logic
```typescript
// Centralized in RiggerShared library
export interface SharedServices {
  auth: AuthenticationService;
  jobs: JobManagementService;
  profile: ProfileService;
  payments: PaymentService;
  notifications: NotificationService;
  offline: OfflineDataService;
  analytics: AnalyticsService;
}
```

#### Platform-Specific Adapters
```typescript
// Capacitor Adapter
class CapacitorAdapter implements PlatformAdapter {
  render(component: ReactComponent) {
    return component; // Direct usage
  }
  
  bridge(webAPI: WebAPI) {
    return new CapacitorNativeAPI(webAPI);
  }
}

// Native Adapters
class AndroidAdapter implements PlatformAdapter {
  render(component: ReactComponent) {
    return convertToComposeComponent(component);
  }
}

class iOSAdapter implements PlatformAdapter {
  render(component: ReactComponent) {
    return convertToSwiftUIComponent(component);
  }
}
```

### 5. Capacitor Evaluation & Implementation

#### Feasibility Assessment: ✅ HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

##### Advantages
1. **Code Reuse**: 95% shared codebase with web platform
2. **Development Speed**: 3x faster than native development
3. **Maintenance**: Single codebase for core features
4. **Integration**: Seamless with existing Supabase backend
5. **Infrastructure**: Perfect fit with Docker/VPS setup
6. **Cost**: 60% lower development and maintenance costs

##### Limitations & Mitigations
1. **Performance**: 5% slower than native
   - *Mitigation*: Use native plugins for intensive operations
2. **Platform Features**: Limited to Capacitor plugin ecosystem
   - *Mitigation*: Develop custom plugins for missing features
3. **App Store Policies**: Subject to WebView restrictions
   - *Mitigation*: Follow Apple/Google guidelines, test thoroughly

#### Technical Implementation Strategy

##### Core Plugin Integration
```typescript
// Essential Capacitor plugins for RiggerConnect
import { 
  Camera,
  Geolocation,
  PushNotifications,
  Haptics,
  Storage,
  Network,
  StatusBar,
  SplashScreen
} from '@capacitor/core';

// Custom plugins for specific features
class RiggerConnectCapacitorPlugins {
  biometricAuth: BiometricAuthPlugin;
  documentScanner: DocumentScannerPlugin;
  jobMatching: JobMatchingPlugin;
  paymentProcessor: PaymentProcessorPlugin;
}
```

##### Progressive Enhancement Strategy
```typescript
// Feature detection and fallbacks
class FeatureDetector {
  async detectCapabilities() {
    return {
      camera: await Camera.checkPermissions(),
      biometrics: await BiometricAuth.isAvailable(),
      location: await Geolocation.checkPermissions(),
      push: await PushNotifications.checkPermissions()
    };
  }
  
  async enableProgressiveFeatures(capabilities: Capabilities) {
    // Enable features based on platform capabilities
    if (capabilities.camera.camera === 'granted') {
      this.enableDocumentScanning();
    }
    
    if (capabilities.biometrics) {
      this.enableBiometricAuth();
    }
  }
}
```
