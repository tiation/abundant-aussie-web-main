   - Select "GitHub Actions" as the source

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
   
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
     workflow_dispatch:
   
   permissions:
     contents: read
     pages: write
     id-token: write
   
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
           with:
             node-version: '18'
             cache: 'npm'
         - run: npm ci
         - run: npm run build
         - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
           with:
             path: ./dist
     
     deploy:
       environment:
         name: github-pages
         url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       needs: build
       steps:
         - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
           id: deployment
   ```

3. **Vite Configuration**:
   Update `vite.config.ts` for GitHub Pages:
   ```typescript
   export default defineConfig({
     // ... existing config
     base: '/caleb-stands-strong-web/', // Replace with your repo name
   })
   ```

4. **Access Your Site**:
