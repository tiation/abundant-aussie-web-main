## Quality Standards

As a ChaseWhiteRabbit NGO initiative, all CI/CD processes adhere to:

- **Ethical Development**: Code quality and security standards
- **Enterprise Grade**: Production-ready deployment practices
- **DevOps Best Practices**: Automated testing, security scanning
- **Performance Excellence**: Sub-200ms response time targets
- **Striking Design**: Clean, maintainable pipeline configurations

## Backend-Specific Requirements

### Security Gates
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- OWASP security testing
- Authentication/authorization testing
- Data privacy compliance checks

### Performance Testing
- Load testing (10,000+ req/sec target)
- Response time validation (<200ms 95th percentile)
- Memory usage profiling
- Database performance testing

### API Testing
- Comprehensive endpoint testing
- Contract testing
- Integration testing
- Error handling validation

## Usage

1. **Local Development**: Use scripts in `scripts/` for local builds
2. **Pipeline Triggers**: Automated on push/merge requests
3. **Quality Gates**: Must pass all defined quality thresholds
4. **Deployment**: Follows enterprise deployment protocols
