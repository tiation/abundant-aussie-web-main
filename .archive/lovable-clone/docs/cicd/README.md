# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
This repository is configured with a CI/CD pipeline that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying your application using GitHub Actions and Docker.

## CI/CD Workflow
The following jobs are implemented in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:

1. **Lint and Test**: Checks out the code, installs dependencies, runs linter and tests.
2. **Security Scanning**: Runs security scans using Trivy and uploads results.
3. **Build Docker Image**: Builds and pushes Docker images based on the branch (main or develop).
4. **Deploy to Staging**: Deploys to a staging environment using SSH.
5. **Deploy to Production**: Deploys to a production environment using SSH.
6. **Notification**: Sends a Slack notification with the status of the deployment.

## Docker Integration
Docker hosting and integration are required for full CI/CD operation:

- **Docker Registry**: Images are pushed to `docker.sxc.codes`.
- **Docker Hosts**: Staging and production deployment utilizes SSH.

### Environment Variables
Ensure the following GitHub Secrets are configured for full pipeline functionality:

- `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` for Docker registry access.
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` for SSH access to remote hosts.
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` for notifications.

## Steps to Integrate with Pipelines
1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Modify `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` to adjust configurations as necessary (e.g., `DOCKER_REGISTRY`, branch names).
3. Configure your Docker registry credentials and SSH keys in GitHub Secrets.
4. **Run Local Builds**: Use Docker Compose for testing multi-container setups locally.

See `[docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml)` for local development configuration.

## Monitoring and Logging
In a production environment:
- Use Prometheus and Grafana for metrics visualization.
- Use Loki for log aggregation.

See `[docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml)` for monitoring configuration.
