### 2.2 Native Mobile Apps (Priority 3)
**Repositories**: 
- `/Users/tiaastor/Github/tiation-repos/RiggerConnect-android`
- `/Users/tiaastor/Github/tiation-repos/RiggerConnect-ios`
- `/Users/tiaastor/Github/tiation-repos/RiggerHub-android`
- `/Users/tiaastor/Github/tiation-repos/RiggerHub-ios`

**Actions**:
- [ ] Create platform-specific adapters for shared utilities
- [ ] Implement shared constants in platform-specific formats
- [ ] Create bridge components for shared validation logic
- [ ] Establish consistent error handling across platforms

## Phase 3: Advanced Integration (Week 3)

### 3.1 Enhanced Shared Library
**Repository**: `/Users/tiaastor/Github/tiation-repos/RiggerShared`

**Actions**:
- [ ] Add mobile-specific utilities
- [ ] Create Capacitor plugin wrappers
- [ ] Add Australian compliance utilities (ABN, TFN validation)
- [ ] Implement industry-specific validation (Mining, Construction)
- [ ] Add advanced logging for mobile environments
- [ ] Create shared notification utilities

### 3.2 Cross-Platform Services
**Actions**:
- [ ] Create shared authentication service
- [ ] Implement shared job matching algorithms
- [ ] Create unified notification service
- [ ] Implement shared analytics service
- [ ] Create shared file upload utilities

## Phase 4: Cloud Deployment Preparation (Week 4)

### 4.1 Infrastructure Integration
**Actions**:
- [ ] Update Docker configurations to use shared libraries
- [ ] Modify CI/CD pipelines for shared dependency management
- [ ] Create shared configuration management
- [ ] Implement shared monitoring and logging infrastructure
- [ ] Create shared security utilities

### 4.2 Production Readiness
**Actions**:
- [ ] Performance testing with shared libraries
- [ ] Security audit of shared components
- [ ] Load testing across all platforms
- [ ] Documentation updates for deployment
- [ ] Create shared deployment scripts

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
# For each repository
npm install file:../RiggerShared/rigger-shared-1.0.0.tgz
# OR after publishing to npm
npm install @rigger/shared@^1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Update Import Statements
```javascript
// Replace existing utilities with shared ones
import { 
  Logger, 
  ValidationUtils, 
  StringUtils, 
  DateUtils,
  UserRoles,
  JobStatus,
  ErrorCodes 
} from '@rigger/shared';
```

### Step 3: Refactor Existing Code
- Replace custom validation with ValidationUtils
- Replace custom logging with shared Logger
- Replace hardcoded constants with shared types
- Standardize error handling using ErrorUtils

### Step 4: Testing and Validation
- Unit tests for shared library integration
- Integration tests across all platforms
- End-to-end testing for critical user flows
- Performance benchmarking

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] 90% reduction in duplicate code across repositories
- [ ] 100% consistent logging format across all services
- [ ] 95% test coverage for shared library integration
- [ ] 50% reduction in development time for new features

### Business Metrics
- [ ] Faster deployment cycles (target: 50% improvement)
- [ ] Reduced bug reports related to validation inconsistencies
- [ ] Improved developer onboarding experience
- [ ] Enhanced platform reliability and consistency
