### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

#### Shadow Enhancement Pattern:
```swift
.foregroundColor(.white) // High-contrast white text
.shadow(color: .black.opacity(0.2), radius: 1, x: 1, y: 1) // Enhanced readability
```

#### Custom Text Modifier:
```swift
struct CustomTextModifier: ViewModifier {
    @ObservedObject var settings: UserSettingsManager
    let baseFont: Font
    
    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .font(baseFont)
            .foregroundColor(settings.effectiveTextColor)
            .modifier(settings.shadowModifier)
            .scaleEffect(settings.fontSize.scale)
    }
}
```

### 🎯 Accessibility Improvements
